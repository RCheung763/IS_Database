# International Student Database

Each year, hundreds of thousands of international students face unique challenges in finding suitable a college to complete their undergrad.  Existing college search engines lack detailed international student-specific information making the process tedious and inefficient. Often college websites can be hard to navigate. The chances of overlooking suitable school is high.  A centralized database needed for efficient search and match process, aiding in time and money allocation.

This database was created to assist the international student match with their ideal college to complete their undergraduate degree. This database simplifies the search phase of the application process and allows the student to track their applications. It makes gathering and evaluating details related to schools, departments, programs, courses, and admission requirements easy and efficient. It allows for students to input their information as well as programs of interest  and returns a list of fitting programs.  By aggregating all information important to an international student into one place it will help with application strategy and reduce the chances that the student will miss a fitting program. 

Admission rates published on University website often do not reflect the admission rates of international students. Student acceptance information can be used to create acceptance rates that could help the applicant to gauge their chances of admission, no identifying information will be used. This information can allow the student to create a better application strategy.
